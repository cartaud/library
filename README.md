## library
keep track of books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read in the future.
### Instructions 
To add a book to your list, hit the '+ Add Book' button and then fill in the form that appears with the book title, author, page numbers, and if you have read it or not. Once the form is complete, click on the submit button and you will see a card appear with all of the information you just entered on the screen. On the card you will see two buttons, a 'Read' button and a 'Remove' button. If you have read the book already, the button will appear green, but if you haven't read it, the button will be red. Once you have read the book simply click on the button to turn the color from red to green showing that you have read the book or you can click the remove button to remove the card from your library all together.
